Hey there! Thanks for visiting my blog, this blog is completely made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) so I kept the remaining parts from the original About page at [Lanyon repo](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). Additionally you can take a look at my [fork](https://github.com/RockyRx/rockyrx.github.io) of this beautiful theme.

Find me on Twitter [@oshadhaviraj](https://twitter.com/oshadhaviraj).

----------

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
