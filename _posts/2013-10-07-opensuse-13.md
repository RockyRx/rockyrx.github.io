It’s been a while since the [openSUSE 13.1 beta](http://news.opensuse.org/2013/09/19/opensuse-13-1-beta-is-out/) is released. And now it’s just a matter of time until the official release. [RC1 is coming on Thursday]
Anyhow I managed to get it run on own and have tried few exercises too. Here, take a look

So as a SUSE user I’m putting my blog’s background picture to a nice art work made by the community. You can see the gecko face in between the posts, well it didn’t work as I expected but still it look pretty sleek.

You can check out other [promotion](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/10/07/help-promote-opensuse-13-1/) fun sparks and suggested [goals](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Goals_13.1) for openSUSE 13.1

Have fun..!

**Update:** It’s out..! But I didn’t have much time on checking it out. Hoping to do a run through, let’s see how it goes this time.
