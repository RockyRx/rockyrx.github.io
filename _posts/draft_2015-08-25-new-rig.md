Well, I finally finished up building my RIG. I have plan this for a month ago and did a little research on the prospective hardware too. My initial idea was to build it with Intel 4th generation processor and the compatible hardware, but the I couldn't resist the hype of Intel's 6th generation processors even it has a very little advantage over the 4th generation processors.

I also want this RIG to use for multipurpose tasks, not only gaming. So for the time being I avoid the complications in hardware when it comes to overclocking, but I did not completely throw away the idea of overclocking, well at least in future. [You'll get an idea when you see the actual specifications]

So lets see the system's hardware specifications.

- **Processor:** Intel Core I5-6600K 6M Skylake Quad-Core 3.5 Ghz
- **Motherboard:** Asrock B150 Gaming K4
- **RAM:** G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 8GB (2 X 4GB)
- **Power supply:** LEPA 550W ATX 80 PLUS BRONZE Certified Hybrid Modular Active PFC Power Supply
- **Storage:** Samsung 850 EVO 2.5" 250GB SATA III Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)
  - **Secondary:** Samsung 500GB SATA HDD
- **Graphics:** Zotac GTX 660 2GB [I took this from my previous build and planning to upgrade it to Asus GeForce GTX 960 2GB STRIX â€‹DC2OC-2GD5]
- **Coooling:** Corsair H60 Hydro Cooler
- **Case:** Corsair carbide-series SPEC 03

I bought most of these components from [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/) and re-shiped to Sri Lanka via [MyUS](https://www.myus.com/). I only took the casing and the CPU cooler from a local store. The reason for that is the lack of hardware components choice we got here in Sri Lanka. On the bright side it somehow saved the total build cost for me as well when it compared to the local prices.
